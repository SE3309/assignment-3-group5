## Why This Approach is Effective

The `Insertion.py` script provides a structured and efficient way to fabricate data tailored specifically for the database schema. By generating data programmatically, it ensures that all attributes, such as `licenseNumber`, `VIN`, and `driverName`, align with the schema’s defined constraints. The script maintains relational integrity by correctly linking primary and foreign keys across tables, such as referencing `driverID` in related tables like Truck and Trailer. This ensures the database’s relationships are properly validated, making the fabricated data highly effective for testing schema functionality. Additionally, the self-contained nature of the script eliminates the need for external libraries, giving full control over the data generation process and making it lightweight and adaptable.

Another strength of this approach is its flexibility and transparency. The script can be easily modified to generate varying volumes of data or adapt attributes based on evolving requirements, making it suitable for a wide range of testing scenarios. Furthermore, the inclusion of a `database_population_log.txt` file enhances usability by providing a detailed record of each data insertion, including successes and errors, allowing for easy debugging and process verification. The method is also scalable, supporting the creation of large datasets for performance testing. Overall, this approach ensures the fabricated data is realistic, consistent, and an invaluable asset for validating and optimizing database performance.
